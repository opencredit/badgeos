Easily create badges and set up the steps and achievements users complete to earn them. Badges are Mozilla OBI compatible and sharable via Credly.

== Description ==

[BadgeOS](http://badgeos.org "BadgeOS")&trade; turns your WordPress site into an achievement and badging system. Your site's users complete steps, demonstrate skills and knowledge, and earn digital badges. Easily define the achievements, organize the badge requirements any way you like, and choose from and combine a range of assessment options to determine whether each task or requirement has been achieved.

Create badges and set up the achievements to earn them. Badges are Mozilla OBI compatible and sharable via [Credly](https://credly.com/ "Credly.com"), the free web service for recognizing and displaying lifelong achievement.

BadgeOS is extremely powerful and infinitely extensible. Check out some of the out-of-the-box features:


**Many ways to define achievements and give badges**

*   Reviewed submissions,
*   Auto-approving submissions,
*   Nominations and review,
*   Site activity (triggers based on commenting and logging in to your site),
*   Completing specific other achievements one or a specific number of times,
*   Completing one, select or all achievements of a specific type,
*   Point thresholds,
*   Admin Given Badges


**Define an Unlimited Number of Achievement Types**

*   Create as many types of achievement as you like
*   Name achievement types whatever you wish
*   Easily define how they relate to one another using the 'Required Steps' tool
*   Set default images for each achievement type or select unique images for every achievement item.


**Sharable Badges with Credly Integration**

*   Badges are Mozilla Open Badge (OBI) compatible through integration of the "Open Credit" API by [Credly](https://credly.com/ "Credly.com"), the free web service for issuing, earning and sharing badges.
*   Connect your Credly account to your BadgeOS site and voila! You're using WordPress to issue "Open Badges" that can be displayed virtually anywhere.
*   Badges you create in BadgeOS automatically appear and update on Credly
*   Use Credly iOS app to issue badges you created on your WordPress site.
*   As badges are earned on WordPress, they can be automatically sent to Credly for easy sharing on Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, Mozilla Backpack, the earner's own web site, blog, or Credly profile.


**'Required Steps' Manager**

*   Simple yet powerful admin interface for defining the "Required Steps" for any badge or achievement.
*   Easily link together one or more triggers, steps or actions into the conditions needed to earn a badge or mark an achievement.


**Reward User Progress**

*   Issue badges for any combination of achievements
*   Award points for commenting, logging in, making submissions, completing tasks


**View and Issue your BadgeOS badges via iOS Mobile App**

*   Badges created in BadgeOS are immediately available on the Credly iOS mobile app (with free Credly integration enabled).
*   Create badges in WordPress, and then issue them from your iPhone!
*   BadgeOS badge earners can receive, accept, view and share their badges from the iOS app (with their profile set to receive badges via Credly).
*   Credly app's "ID Card" view essentially turns a BadgeOS badge into an "access pass" for face-to-face activities.


**Earned Badges Widget**

* Shows logged in users what badges they have earned.
* Set the parameters for the widget to decide how many recent badges to display.
* Members can share their badges right from the widget to their Credly profile and off to their linked social networks or Mozilla Backpack.
